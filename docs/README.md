## Data Explorer

Create discrete data analysis steps for **what-if** analysis of _complex data_

Now it's dockerized. Run the following commands after you install docker (and docker-compose):

if you don't have this repository:
mkdir explorer
cd explorer
git clone https://github.com/ahmetrasit/explorer
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d


Check localhost:8001 if it's running. If not, good luck ;) just contact me.
